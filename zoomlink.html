                Zoom has become one of the primary videoconferencing platforms for the education sector. Zoom has 
                tools and features that many are unaware of how to access quickly and efficiently. Our product is geared towards making the 
                Zoom experience easier. It will be a USB device that connects to the computer. It will feature a touchscreen with tools
                not readily displayed on Zoom, programmable physical buttons below the touchscreen, and LEDs above the touchscreen to signal
                when the associated button is on.

        <h3 id="plan">Collaboration Plan</h3>
        <p>
          The primary form of collaboration will be Zoom meetings at least once per week. A text based chat will set up for quick communication 
          regarding planning and any minor issues encountered throughout the week. A shared Google Doc to collaborate on any project notes and 
          documentation. A shared Github repository will be used to share all code involved in the project. As a general plan, each week team 
          members will be assigned their own tasks to complete before the next meeting. This strategy will help keep the team motivated to continue
          moving forward with the project.
        </br>
      </br>
          The team has agreed to maintain open communication throughout the entire project. To resolve a conflict, the team will meet on zoom and 
          discuss the issue. One conflict that could occur is a team member not completing their assigned task for the week. The member will be 
          expected to provide their reasoning to the rest of the group, and will be expected to finish their portion. The text chat will also be a 
          useful tool for resolving conflicts quickly. This will allow the team to make adjustments quickly to ensure that all deadlines are met. 
        </br>
      </br>
          The budget of the project will be evenly distributed among each member of the team. Each member will purchase individual components as 
          needed and keep track of all expenses. At the end of the project, these expenses will be reviewed as a group and divided evenly.

          <p>These solutions will need time to be investigated and tested to ensure they will work with our project. To start, we will
            be investigating USB. Luke will be leading the USB communication from the device to the user's computer. John and McKay will work 
            together on creating a program that will take the data received from the device and execute the desired commands. Benjamin will
            be reading into the Zoom API to see if it is possible to have the program created by John and McKay directly communicate with 
            Zoom. <br>
            Once these items are complete, more functionality can be added. Ensuring this device will continue to function when an update occurs will
            be within the next run of objectives to accomplish. When we feel comfortable with the project's ability to handle Zoom, making our product
            accessible and compatible with other videoconferencing services will be our next objectives. <br>
            Potential problems that could arise from the Raspberry Pi include a variety of things. The Raspberry Pi we select may not have
            enough input pins for the 3 physical keys, so reading the documentation before purchase must be done. The keys documentation will also
            be read to ensure compatibilty with the Raspberry Pi. <br>
            On the software end, there may not be a way to use Zoom's API to make programming easier. If this occurs, our device will have to use keyboard
            and mouse commands to achieve our desired effects.

        <p>For the prototype due at the end of Spring Semester 2021, we will be focusing on a Zoom specific device for students. The touchscreen
          will have 2-3 of Zoom's features available to use, and the physical buttons will be for the microphone, raising the user's hand, and the 
          camera.
